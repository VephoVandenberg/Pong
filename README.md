# Pong

This is a pong game copy. From which will be created a 2D game enginge. The way of how the project was build is not common, because I'm using MSVC 2019 and batch files. So, if you want to test out the game itself, then just download the .rar file, and put the contence of the archive to one directory. 

# Controls
- W and S - left paddle
- Up and Down - right paddle
